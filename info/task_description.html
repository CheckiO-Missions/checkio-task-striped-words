<p>
    Our robots are always working to build their linguistic skills.
    For this mission, they are researching the latin alphabet and its applications.
</p>

<p>
    The alphabet contains both vowel and consonant letters (Yes, we divide the letters).<br>
    Vowels -- <strong>A E I O U Y</strong><br>
    Consonants -- <strong>B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You are given a block of text with various different words. 
    These words are separated by whitespaces and punctuation marks.
    Numbers are not considered words in this mission (a mix of letters and digits is not a word too).
    You should count the number of words (striped words) where the vowels with consonants are alternating,
    that is; words that you count cannot have two consecutive vowels or consonants.
    The words consisting of a single letter are not striped -- do not count it. Case is not significant for this mission.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text. A string (unicode)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A quantity of striped words. An integer.

    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio("My name is ...") == 3
checkio("Hello world") == 0
checkio("A quantity of striped words.") == 1, "Only of"
checkio("Dog,cat,mouse,bird.Human.") == 3</pre>
